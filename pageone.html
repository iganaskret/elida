            <p>
                Have you ever thought about the fact, that humans (and their pets, fed by humans) are the only ones in the world to drink milk of another species? Have you ever wondered how the milk industry works? Do you know, what kind of influence it has on our planet? Or on our health? <br> <br> We did!
            </p>
            <p>
                We care about animals, we care about our health and we care about Earth. That’s why we want to encourage you to try going dairy free for 14 days. It’s so easy! During the challenge we will help you make good choices, we will give you recipes, motivation and a lot of knowledge. Who knows, maybe after 14 days you just won’t want to stop?
