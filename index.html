            Cows are intelligent and social animals who prefer to be together and create complex social ties to each other. They are emotionally complex and even have the ability to worry about the future. <br> <br>

            Thus, one has experienced cows that have used their intelligence to carry out various farms, such as climbing a fence to escape from a slaughterhouse, and walking several kilometers to reunite with a calf. <br> <br>

            In Denmark, we have about 500,000 dairy cows , each producing an average of 9,000 kg of milk annually, or 25 - 40 liters daily.

            The biggest animal welfare problems in Danish milk production are:
            <ul>
                <li> 72% of Danish dairy cows never reach grass </li>
                <li> Cow and calf are separated a few hours after birth </li>
                <li> All conventional calves are cut </li>
                <li> Thousands of bull calves are killed shortly a after birth </li>
            </ul>
            Many cows suffer from udder inflammation.
            In the following sections, you can read more about the dairy cow's life, including; cows in nature, cows in modern milk production and prospects for milk production in Denmark.

                <li class="ol"> Short lifespan.</li>
                <p>
                    After period of six months , the cow is moved to a crowded feedlot with hundreds or thousands of other cows. Here their diet changed to one of mostly grain, which is very harmful for their bodies and can cause digestive issues, pain and even death.
                </p>
                <li class="ol"> Losing the babies. </li>
                <p>
                    When a baby cow is born, she is taken from her mother within 24 hours, if not immediately. The primary reason she does not stay with her mother is so that she does not drink up all the farmer’s profit (e.g. her mother’s milk).
                </p>
                <li class="ol"> Physical pain. </li>
                <p>
                    After her baby is taken from her, the dairy cow is hooked up to machines for milking which are very painful for cows.. Currently, the average “dairy cows each produce about 100 pounds of milk per day — 10 times more than cows living just a few decades ago. This is due to bovine growth hormones, unnatural diets and being bred selectively for massive milk production.
                </p>
                <li class="ol"> Unethical treatment. </li>
                <p>
                    In order to “give milk,” a dairy cow must be artificially inseminated, because just like humans, she will not produce milk if there isn’t a baby to feed. While many say that cows only need to be pregnant once, the sad fact is that in modern factory farming they are inseminated every year in order to keep milk production as high as possible, not to mention the industry also profits from their babies.
