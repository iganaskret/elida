            Cows are intelligent and social animals who prefer to be together and create complex social ties to each other. They are emotionally complex and even have the ability to worry about the future. <br> <br>

            Thus, one has experienced cows that have used their intelligence to carry out various farms, such as climbing a fence to escape from a slaughterhouse, and walking several kilometers to reunite with a calf. <br> <br>

            In Denmark, we have about 500,000 dairy cows , each producing an average of 9,000 kg of milk annually, or 25 - 40 liters daily.

            The biggest animal welfare problems in Danish milk production are:
        <ul>
            <li> 72% of Danish dairy cows never reach grass </li>
            <li> Cow and calf are separated a few hours after birth </li>
            <li> All conventional calves are cut </li>
            <li> Thousands of bull calves are killed shortly a after birth </li>
        </ul>
            Many cows suffer from udder inflammation.
            In the following sections, you can read more about the dairy cow's life, including; cows in nature, cows in modern milk production and prospects for milk production in Denmark.
